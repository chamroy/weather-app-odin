# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The project focuses on learning and implementing modern JavaScript concepts such as **async/await**, **Promises**, and working with **APIs**.

## Features
- Fetch real-time weather data from an API.
- Display current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and more.
- User-friendly interface with a clean design.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding **asynchronous JavaScript** (async/await, Promises).
- Working with **APIs** to fetch and display data.
- Handling user input and updating the DOM dynamically.
- Using modern build tools like **Vite** for development.

## Live Demo
